The cookie factory needs a way to sort all the cookies they have from ascending to descending for their website. Lets say the input is `(3, 5, 1, 9, 7)`, it needs to be sorted from highest to lowest, so to something like this `(9, 7, 5, 3, 1)`, how can you achieve this in pure JavaScript? Show your answer in JavaScript and your output as well.. good luck your input is `(6, 9, 5, 2, 4)`!
